Achieving 75% code coverage in Salesforce is a requirement for deploying your Apex code to a production environment. It means that at least 75% of your Apex code must be covered by test methods in your test classes. Here are some tips to help you achieve and maintain the required code coverage:

1. **Write Comprehensive Test Methods:**
   - Create test methods that cover various scenarios, including positive and negative test cases.
   - Aim to test every code path and logic branch within your Apex classes and triggers.
   - Cover both success and error conditions in your test methods.

2. **Use `System.assert()`:**
   - Use assertions to validate that your code behaves as expected. Assert the actual results against the expected results.
   - For example, use `System.assert(expectedResult == actualResult)` to ensure that your code produces the correct outcomes.

3. **Test Data Setup:**
   - Create the necessary test data within your test methods. Ensure that the test data represents different scenarios and edge cases.
   - Avoid relying on hard-coded record IDs, as they can differ between environments.

4. **Isolate Test Data:**
   - Isolate the test data by creating and deleting records in a test context.
   - Use the `@testSetup` annotation to create common test data that can be reused across multiple test methods.

5. **Control Test Context:**
   - Use `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` to delineate the portions of your code you want to measure for governor limits. This is especially important for testing asynchronous code, such as future and batch operations.

6. **Bulk Testing:**
   - Test bulk operations by creating and processing multiple records in a single test method. Ensure your code performs efficiently when handling large datasets.

7. **Utilize Different Test Classes:**
   - Divide your test methods across different test classes to achieve better code coverage.
   - Ensure that each test class focuses on testing specific components or features of your application.

8. **Create Test Data Method:**
   - Consider creating a separate utility method in your test class for creating test data. This can make your test methods cleaner and more focused on testing the code.

9. **Review and Update Tests:**
   - Regularly review your test methods and update them as your code evolves. Ensure that new features and code changes are covered by tests.
   - Retest your code after making changes to ensure that it still meets the required coverage.

10. **Maintain Quality Code:**
    - Write clean and well-structured code. Well-organized code is easier to test and maintain.
    - Follow best practices for coding and design to make your code testable.

11. **Consider Using Mocks:**
    - When testing code that interacts with external systems or APIs, consider using mocking frameworks to simulate external interactions without making actual requests.

12. **Governor Limits:**
    - Be aware of Salesforce governor limits and ensure that your code does not exceed these limits, both in your production code and your test methods.

By following these best practices and continuously testing your code as you develop and update it, you can achieve and maintain the 75% code coverage requirement. Additionally, you'll have more reliable and robust applications that are easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
