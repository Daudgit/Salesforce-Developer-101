In Salesforce, `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` are two special methods used within test classes to control the execution context of test methods. They are used to delineate the portions of code that you want to measure when calculating governor limits and to ensure that asynchronous code, such as future and batch operations, is executed properly during testing. Here's how they work:

1. **`Test.startTest()`:**
   - The `Test.startTest()` method marks the beginning of a block of code within a test method that you want to measure for governor limits. It essentially resets the governor limits for the code that follows it, allowing you to assess the consumption of resources within that block.
   - Use `Test.startTest()` before executing the code you want to measure.

   ```apex
   Test.startTest();
   // Code to measure for governor limits
   ```

2. **`Test.stopTest()`:**
   - The `Test.stopTest()` method marks the end of the block of code you want to measure. It effectively ends the "inner" execution context and resets the governor limits again. Any asynchronous operations, such as future or batch code, that are enqueued within the `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` blocks will execute synchronously after `Test.stopTest()`.

   ```apex
   // Code within Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest()
   Test.stopTest();
   ```

Here's why these methods are useful:

- **Synchronous Execution:** Normally, in a test method, asynchronous operations are not executed immediately. They are enqueued and executed only after the test method completes. This can make it challenging to test asynchronous code and calculate governor limits accurately.

- **Resource Measurement:** By using `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()`, you can measure the resource consumption, such as CPU time and heap size, for a specific section of code. This allows you to ensure that your code stays within governor limits, even when dealing with asynchronous operations.

Example:

```apex
@isTest
public class MyTest {
    @isTest
    static void testMyCode() {
        // Set up test data

        // Enqueue a future method
        System.enqueueJob(new MyFutureClass());

        // Start measuring resource consumption
        Test.startTest();

        // Execute code to be measured
        // This is where you test your synchronous and asynchronous code

        // End measurement and ensure that the asynchronous operation has completed
        Test.stopTest();

        // Perform assertions and validate results
    }
}
```

With `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()`, you can accurately measure the impact of your code on governor limits and ensure that asynchronous operations execute correctly in your test methods. This is particularly useful for testing code that relies on future methods, batch jobs, and other asynchronous processes.
