The `Database` class in Salesforce provides a set of methods that allow you to perform various database-related operations, such as DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations, querying, and batch processing. It is commonly used in Apex code to interact with the Salesforce database. Here are some common use cases and methods of the `Database` class:

**1. Insert Records:**

You can use the `Database.insert()` method to insert one or more records into the database. This method returns a `Database.SaveResult` object that contains information about the success or failure of the DML operation.

```apex
List<Account> accountsToInsert = new List<Account>();
// Populate the accountsToInsert list
Database.SaveResult[] insertResults = Database.insert(accountsToInsert, false);
```

**2. Update Records:**

The `Database.update()` method is used to update one or more records in the database. Like `insert()`, it returns a `Database.SaveResult` object.

```apex
List<Contact> contactsToUpdate = new List<Contact>();
// Populate the contactsToUpdate list
Database.SaveResult[] updateResults = Database.update(contactsToUpdate, false);
```

**3. Delete Records:**

You can use the `Database.delete()` method to delete one or more records. It also returns a `Database.SaveResult` object.

```apex
List<Custom_Object__c> recordsToDelete = new List<Custom_Object__c>();
// Populate the recordsToDelete list
Database.SaveResult[] deleteResults = Database.delete(recordsToDelete, false);
```

**4. Query Records:**

The `Database.query()` method allows you to execute a dynamic SOQL query and retrieve query results. It returns a `Database.QueryLocator` object, which can be used to iterate through the query results in a batch process.

```apex
String dynamicQuery = 'SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = :industryValue';
Database.QueryLocator queryLocator = Database.getQueryLocator(dynamicQuery);
```

**5. Batch Processing:**

The `Database.executeBatch()` method is used to execute batch Apex jobs. You can implement batch processing by creating a class that implements the `Database.Batchable` interface and then invoking it using this method.

```apex
MyBatchableClass batchable = new MyBatchableClass();
Database.executeBatch(batchable, 200);
```

**6. Handle Save Results:**

The `Database.SaveResult` object contains information about the success or failure of DML operations. You can inspect this object to determine which records were successfully saved and which encountered errors.

```apex
for (Database.SaveResult result : insertResults) {
    if (result.isSuccess()) {
        // Record was successfully inserted
    } else {
        // Handle insertion error
    }
}
```

The `Database` class is a powerful tool for working with the Salesforce database in Apex. It is often used in scenarios where you need to handle bulk operations or interact with the database in a more controlled manner. When using the `Database` class, be sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately, and consider bulk processing to stay within Salesforce governor limits.
