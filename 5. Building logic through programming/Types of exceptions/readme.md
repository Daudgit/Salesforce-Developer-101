In Salesforce Apex, exceptions can be categorized into two main types: system exceptions and custom exceptions. Here's a breakdown of each type:

**1. System Exceptions:**
   - System exceptions are exceptions that are thrown by the Salesforce system itself. These exceptions are usually related to the platform's built-in limitations, rules, and constraints. They are typically not caught explicitly by your code but are instead handled by the platform.

   Some common examples of system exceptions include:
   - Governor Limit Exceptions: These exceptions are thrown when your code exceeds the predefined limits set by Salesforce, such as the maximum number of SOQL queries, CPU time, heap size, and more.
   - QueryException: Thrown when there is a problem with a query or when a query results in no records.
   - DmlException: Occurs when there is an issue with a data manipulation language (DML) operation, such as insert, update, delete, or undelete. This can include issues with record validation rules, triggers, or duplicate rules.

**2. Custom Exceptions:**
   - Custom exceptions are exceptions that you define and throw in your own Apex code to handle specific error conditions or business logic. You create custom exception classes that extend the built-in `Exception` class or implement the `Exception` interface.

   Some common examples of custom exceptions include:
   - CustomLimitExceededException: Used to handle custom limits or count-related errors, such as exceeding a custom defined limit for a specific operation.
   - CustomValidationException: Thrown when custom validation rules are not met, such as data validation or business rules.
   - CustomDataAccessException: Used to handle custom data access errors, like failed attempts to access external data sources.

Custom exceptions allow you to add context to the error and handle errors specific to your application's requirements.

**3. Standard Apex Exceptions:**
   - In addition to system exceptions and custom exceptions, Salesforce also provides a set of standard Apex exceptions. These exceptions are part of the Apex language and can be caught and handled in your code.

   Some standard Apex exceptions include:
   - NullPointerException: Occurs when you attempt to access or perform an operation on a null object.
   - ListException: Thrown when there is an issue with list manipulation or operations, such as attempting to access an element out of bounds.
   - InvalidParameterValueException: Raised when an invalid parameter or argument is passed to a method or function.
   - InvalidQueryLocatorException: Occurs when an invalid query locator is used in database operations.

Understanding and handling these exceptions is essential for building robust, reliable, and error-tolerant Apex code. By using the appropriate exceptions and exception handling techniques, you can ensure your code is resilient to errors and provides meaningful error messages when issues arise.
