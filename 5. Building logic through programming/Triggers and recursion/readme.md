Triggers and recursion in Salesforce are important concepts to understand, as they relate to how triggers are executed and how to control their behavior when dealing with related objects. Let's explore these concepts in more detail:

**1. Triggers:**
   - In Salesforce, triggers are pieces of Apex code that are executed in response to Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations (e.g., insert, update, delete) on records. Triggers can be defined on specific objects (e.g., Account, Contact) and specific events (e.g., before insert, after update).
   - Triggers can perform various actions, such as data validation, record updates, sending emails, and more, when records are modified.
   - Triggers execute once per trigger event, not once per record, meaning that they process all records involved in the event as a batch.

**2. Trigger Execution Order:**
   - In Salesforce, triggers are executed in a specific order. For example, "before" triggers (e.g., before insert, before update) execute before "after" triggers (e.g., after insert, after update).
   - When multiple triggers are defined on the same object and event, Salesforce follows a specific order of execution to ensure that data is processed consistently.

**3. Recursion:**
   - Trigger recursion refers to situations where a trigger, during its execution, causes the same trigger to execute again. This can lead to a chain reaction, where the same trigger is executed repeatedly.

**4. Common Causes of Recursion:**
   - Recursion can be caused by various scenarios, including:
     - Trigger logic that updates or inserts records, causing the same trigger event to be fired.
     - Workflow rules, process builder, or other automation that updates records involved in the trigger event.
     - Cross-object relationships and updates that trigger cascading updates on related objects.

**5. Preventing Recursion:**
   - To prevent trigger recursion, Salesforce provides a built-in feature called "Trigger Context Variables." By using these variables, you can control when and how triggers execute.
   - A common approach to preventing recursion is to use a static Boolean variable (often referred to as a "trigger handler" or "trigger context") to indicate whether the trigger logic has already run in the current execution context.
   - You can use this Boolean variable to skip trigger logic on subsequent trigger executions during the same transaction.

Here's a simplified example of a trigger handler that prevents recursion in an "after update" trigger:

```apex
public class AccountTriggerHandler {
    private static Boolean isExecuting = false;

    public static void onAfterUpdate(List<Account> newAccounts, List<Account> oldAccounts) {
        if (!isExecuting) {
            isExecuting = true;
            // Trigger logic here
            isExecuting = false;
        }
    }
}
```

In your trigger, you would call this handler and pass the appropriate `Trigger.new` and `Trigger.old` records.

Preventing and managing trigger recursion is crucial to maintain data integrity and prevent unintended consequences. By using trigger handlers and understanding the order of execution, you can build robust and efficient triggers in Salesforce.
