A trigger framework is an architectural approach in Salesforce that involves organizing trigger code in a structured and modular manner. It aims to promote separation of concerns and make trigger code more maintainable and scalable. Here's an overview of key concepts in a trigger framework, including separation of concerns:

**1. Separation of Concerns:**
   - Separation of concerns is a software design principle that encourages breaking down code into distinct, manageable, and loosely coupled components, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.
   - In the context of trigger frameworks, it means separating different responsibilities or concerns, such as trigger event handling, record-specific logic, and bulk data processing.

**2. Trigger Handlers:**
   - A trigger framework often involves creating separate trigger handler classes for different objects and trigger events (e.g., AccountBeforeInsertHandler, ContactAfterUpdateHandler).
   - Each trigger handler is responsible for a specific trigger event on a specific object, focusing on one concern.

**3. Trigger Dispatcher:**
   - A trigger dispatcher class serves as the entry point for trigger execution. It coordinates the execution of trigger handlers and ensures that they are called in the appropriate order.
   - The dispatcher is responsible for delegating trigger events to the relevant trigger handlers.

**4. Record-Specific Logic:**
   - Separation of concerns allows you to isolate record-specific logic, such as data validation, field updates, and record-specific actions, within the trigger handlers.
   - Each trigger handler focuses on the logic relevant to its specific trigger event and object.

**5. Bulk Data Processing:**
   - Trigger frameworks are designed to handle bulk data processing efficiently. They should be capable of working with large sets of records while maintaining good performance.
   - Record-specific logic should be bulk-safe, and trigger handlers should be able to process collections of records.

**6. Modularity and Reusability:**
   - A well-structured trigger framework promotes modularity, making it easier to reuse trigger logic in different contexts.
   - Trigger handlers can be reused across various projects and organizations.

**7. Unit Testing:**
   - Separation of concerns facilitates unit testing. You can test each trigger handler individually, making it easier to verify their functionality.
   - Unit tests ensure that each handler behaves correctly and is free of errors.

**8. Error Handling:**
   - Error handling and exception management can be handled at the handler level, making it easier to report and handle errors gracefully.

Here's a simplified example of how a trigger framework might be structured:

```apex
public class AccountTriggerDispatcher {
    public static void onBeforeInsert(List<Account> newAccounts) {
        AccountBeforeInsertHandler.handle(newAccounts);
    }

    public static void onAfterUpdate(List<Account> newAccounts, List<Account> oldAccounts) {
        AccountAfterUpdateHandler.handle(newAccounts, oldAccounts);
    }
}

public class AccountBeforeInsertHandler {
    public static void handle(List<Account> newAccounts) {
        // Record-specific logic for before insert event
    }
}

public class AccountAfterUpdateHandler {
    public static void handle(List<Account> newAccounts, List<Account> oldAccounts) {
        // Record-specific logic for after update event
    }
}
```

By following a trigger framework and embracing the principles of separation of concerns, you can create more organized, maintainable, and extensible trigger code in Salesforce. This approach is especially valuable in organizations with complex data models and multiple trigger events.
