Invoking Apex classes from triggers is a common practice in Salesforce to encapsulate and separate complex business logic into reusable classes. This approach enhances code maintainability, readability, and testability. Here's how you can invoke Apex classes from triggers:

**Step 1: Create an Apex Class:**

Create an Apex class that contains the logic you want to execute. For example, let's say you have a trigger on the Case object, and you want to send an email notification when a Case is created.

```apex
public class CaseHandler {
    public static void sendEmailNotification(List<Case> newCases) {
        // Logic to send email notification goes here
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Modify the Trigger:**

Inside the trigger, you can call the method from your Apex class. Here's an example:

```apex
trigger CaseTrigger on Case (after insert) {
    CaseHandler.sendEmailNotification(Trigger.new);
}
```

In this example:
- The trigger is set to execute after Cases are inserted.
- The `CaseHandler.sendEmailNotification` method is called and passed the `Trigger.new` collection, which contains the new Case records.

**Step 3: Bulk Processing:**

Apex triggers are designed to handle records in bulk. The trigger code is automatically bulkified, which means it can process multiple records simultaneously. This is important to ensure efficient processing for large datasets.

**Step 4: Test the Trigger:**

As with any Salesforce code, it's essential to create unit tests to verify the behavior of your trigger and the associated Apex class.

**Advantages of Using Apex Classes with Triggers:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:** By encapsulating business logic in separate classes, you keep triggers focused on trigger-specific concerns like event handling and validation, while complex business logic is organized in separate classes.

2. **Code Reusability:** Apex classes can be reused in multiple triggers or other parts of your codebase, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

3. **Modularity:** When logic is organized into classes, you can easily modify, update, or extend it without affecting other parts of the codebase.

4. **Testability:** Apex classes can be tested in isolation, allowing for more thorough unit testing.

5. **Readability:** Well-structured code with separate classes can be more readable and easier to understand.

By following this approach, you can create clean, efficient, and maintainable code in Salesforce that effectively leverages Apex classes for complex business logic while keeping triggers lightweight and focused on the trigger event itself.
